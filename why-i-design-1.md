Decided to start with my own family business, soon I’d see design thinking applied in several ways to make profit from an excellent customer experience. 
The skills I had earned with graphic design allowed me to tackle problems and design for the eye in general. As time passed by, design thinking flourished 
to deal with customer’s experience and the ‘journey of purchase’ or brand recognition among other systems/concept only companies, no matter how small they are,
can notice, worry about and deal with everyday. This new concept of design able to manage for businnesses, create services, applied to people and to bring ‘pleasure’; 
seamlessly transformed into an ecosystem around the aim: bring value. This was my major concern, the task I had to solve in the business and further adapt it 
to bring solutions to my society. My playground. So now I design to tranform ideas into practical solutions. Though design is not enough; you have to act, 
collaborate with a team, understand all the faces of the problem and be open to accept them, 
focus on achievable goals yet meaningful to make a change and be sensible enough to define the cause you’re pursuing. 
To solve the problem I stated on the first thought, I’m working in project iDEA. An space where people can join other’s people project or create one themselves. 
iDEA is to be everyone’s space, a way to add value to an iDEA by taking action with the aim to create a common mission LAB.
