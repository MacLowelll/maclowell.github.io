    <p class="wyd2">The kind of issue that is challenging to understand, tackle, and you become easily 'consumed' by-sometimes. When I was 5y/o, I'd like to get lost every time I had the chance. 
  Now, I realized it was the way I had to learn, interact, feel the urgency and act.
  It was my lab, my lab of thoughts; from the window of the 'micro' the passegers trying to squeeze among the cars to cross the road, 
  would make me think in how the car's smoke shameless would become part of their clothes, breath but nothing would stop them from doing so. 
  The panels in front of me outrageously advertising everything they touch was our welcoming to the popular district of 'El Agustino'. 
  Soon, stray dogs would assume the play of the passengers and trash bags torn apart were left behind as we arrived. 
  All I saw in these problems was a bad design of ethics, ubanization, brand, transit signalization & way of living. A good design would allow me to 
  make small changes-bring value-to 'things' like that unpleasing, ineffective adverstising.I had in mind that the way of living of my society could improve 
  if they'd appreciate more attractive elements in their environment because it would make them crave for better experiences in their city and life.
  So I started with graphic design. It was nice.</p>
