I'm a self-taught designer and autodidact learner. My aim is to transform practical design into solutions to social problems present in my community.
I firmly believe that design applied as a way/method of thinking can approach an objective yet integrative way to add value to a service/product or goal.
Quantum mechanics, society and logic, and design are on the foundations of my interests and passion.
