[# ME](me.md)
I'm a self-taught designer and autodidact learner. My aim is to transform practical design into solutions to social problems present in my community.
I firmly believe that design applied as a way/method of thinking can approach an objective yet integrative way to add value to a service/product or goal.

# üé≤ Why I design? 
[First I thought of design as the solution to my society's problems](why-i-design-2.md)

[Second, design is not the solution but the core of it.](why-i-design-1.md)

Synthesis: 
If you ever ask me what is design, I'll tell you it's everything.
