I'm a self-taught designer and autodidact learner. My aim is to transform practical design into solutions to social problems present in my community.
I firmly believe that design applied as a way/method of thinking can approach an objective yet integrative way to add value to a service/product or goal.

# Interests
I'm in constant exploration. My focus is to communicate my ideas in an arrange of 
comprehensible visual elements with which people can interact, feel and communicate. 
Short films, animations, creative writing, design in 3D and 2D and other future means.

- Society and Economy
