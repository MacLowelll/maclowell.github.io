I'm a self-taught designer and autodidact learner. My aim is to transform practical design into solutions to social problems present in my community.
I firmly believe that design applied as a way/method of thinking can approach an objective yet integrative way to add value to a service/product or goal.

# ðŸŽ² Why I design? 
[First I thought of design as the solution to my society's problems](why-i-design-2.md)
The kind of issue that is challenging to understand, tackle, and you become easily 'consumed' by-sometimes.
When I was 5y/o, I'd like to get lost every time I had the chance. Now, I realized it was the way I had to learn, interact, feel the urgency and act. 
It was my lab, my lab of thoughts; from the window of the 'micro' the passegers trying to squeeze among the cars to cross the road, would make me think in how the car's smoke shameless would become part of their clothes, breath but nothing would stop them from doing so. The panels in front of me outrageously advertising everything they touch was our welcoming to the popular district of 'El Agustino'. 
Soon, stray dogs would assume the play of the passengers and trash bags torn apart were left behind as we arrived. 
All I saw in these problems was a bad design of ethics, ubanization, brand, transit signalization & way of living. 
A good design would allow me to make small changes (bring value) to 'things' like that unpleasing, ineffective adverstising. 
I had in mind that the way of living of my society could improve if they'd appreciate more attractive elements in their environment 
because it would make them crave for better experiences in their city and life.
So I started with graphic design. It was nice. 

[Second, design is not the solution but the core of it.](why-i-design-1.md)
Decided to start with my own family business, soon I'd see design thinking applied in several ways to make profit from an excellent customer experience. 
The skills I had earned with graphic design allowed me to tackle problems and design for the eye in general. As time passed by, design thinking flourished 
to deal with customer's experience and the 'journey of purchase' or brand recognition among other systems/concept only companies, 
no matter how small they are, can notice, worry about and deal with everyday. This new concept of design able to manage for businnesses, create services, applied to people and to bring 'pleasure'; seamlessly transformed into an ecosystem around the aim: bring value. This was my major concern, the task I had to solve in the business and further adapt it to bring solutions to my society. My playground. 
So now I design to tranform ideas into practical solutions. Though design is not enough; you have to act, collaborate with a team, understand all the faces of the problem and be open to accept them, focus on
achievable goals yet meaningful to make a change and be sensible enough to define the cause you're pursuing.
To solve the problem I stated on the first thought, I'm working in project iDEA. An space where people can join other's people project or create one themselves.
iDEA is to be everyone's space, a way to add value to an iDEA by taking action with the aim to create a common mission LAB.
